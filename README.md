# CodeAlpha_FitnessTrackerApp

🏋️‍♂️ CodeAlpha Fitness Tracker App
This is my third project in the CodeAlpha  Internship, and it's been one of the most fun and rewarding ones so far! 🎉
🔥 About the App
The Fitness Tracker App helps users log and track their workouts 🏃‍♂️, set fitness goals 🎯, view calories burned 🔥, and monitor progress over time 📈. It's built using native iOS tools and stores data locally.
🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
🧱 UIKit – for building the interface
💾 Core Data – to store workout logs and user progress
🎨 ChameleonFramework – for attractive, contrast-aware colors
📦 CocoaPods – for dependency management
🧪 UITableView – to list and manage workout entries
🧠 MVC Architecture – clean and modular structure
🔄 GitHub – for version control and project hosting
💭 My Experience
This project taught me a lot about Core Data and working with real user flows. I enjoyed building the workout tracker screen and connecting data between views. It's exciting to see my app grow with each project in the internship! 😄📲
